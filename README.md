# thanksgiving-pi
Animation of a rejection sampling approach to estimate pi. Did this to troll the ChIDEO 2019 Thanksgiving Pie Baking Contest. Current implementation relies pretty heavily on [Canvas JS](https://canvasjs.com/) and a local installation of [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server) 

# Servin' up the pi
```
npm init -y
npm install lite-server --save-dev
npm run dev
```

## TODO:
 - Use bootstrap and actual stylesheets (ugh)
 - Add stuff to make this a mock recipe
 - Slider bar to control the sampling rate
